# Titanic Survival Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the famous **Titanic dataset** to explore survival factors using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.  
We investigate correlations between passenger demographics, ticket class, embarkation point, and survival rates.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `TITANIC.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing full code and step-by-step analysis.
- `titanic.csv` – Dataset used for analysis.
- `Titanic_Report.pdf` – PDF version of the notebook containing insights and visualizations.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Gender Impact:** Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.
- **Class Impact:** First-class passengers survived more frequently.
- **Age Trends:** Children had higher chances of survival than older passengers.
- **Embarkation Point:** Passengers boarding from certain ports had different survival probabilities.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV Data Handling**
- **Data Visualization**

## 📊 Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and converting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding distributions and relationships.
3. **Visualization:** Survival rate comparisons using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
4. **Insights & Conclusions:** Summary of findings from the dataset.
